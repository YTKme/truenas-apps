# Many Notes

[Many Notes](https://github.com/brufdev/many-notes) is a Markdown
note-taking web application designed for simplicity! Easily create or
import your vaults and organize your thoughts right away.

It uses a database to power its features, but your files are also saved
in the filesystem, giving you full control over your vault structure and
making it easy to access or transfer your files to another application.

Vaults are simply storage containers for your files, and Many Notes lets
you choose to keep all your files in one vault or organize them into
separate vaults.
